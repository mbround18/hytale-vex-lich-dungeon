# Engineering Hub Online

We launched the Vex Developer Hub to consolidate engine messaging, resources, and technical updates in one place.

## Highlights
- New hero banner with current engine status callout.
- Split layout for engineering logs and resource sidebar widgets.
- Author profile card and quick links for docs, UI grimoire, and community resources.

## Notes
- The log feed now reads from `/dev/logs` so updates are pure markdown drops.
- Layout styling mirrors the home page for a unified brand feel.
