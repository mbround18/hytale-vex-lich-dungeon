# UI Grimoire v1

We published the UI Grimoire as a living reference for Hytale UI syntax, patterns, and validation rules.

## Highlights
- Dedicated UI documentation shell with nav-driven sections.
- Syntax highlighting tuned for SCSS and Java to match Hytale UI semantics.
- Reference pages covering rules, patterns, syntax, and validation checklists.

## Notes
- Content is markdown-driven for fast iteration.
- Shared header/nav components keep dev and UI docs consistent.
