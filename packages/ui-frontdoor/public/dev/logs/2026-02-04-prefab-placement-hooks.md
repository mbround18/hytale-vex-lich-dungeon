## Prefab Placement Hooks

We added hook points and tracking to better observe prefab placement and support future spawn logic.

## Highlights

- Introduced prefab placement hook callbacks for discovery, load, and placement events.
- Captured placement metadata for easier debugging and spawn analysis.
- Prepared the prefab system for additional runtime tooling.
