## Vex UI Components + UI Mangle

We shipped a larger Vex UI pass and added UI mangle generation to keep Java bindings in sync.

## Highlights

- Introduced new Vex UI pages and HUDs (leaderboard, portal countdown, dungeon summary, widgets).
- Added UI mangle functionality to generate Java classes from UI definitions.
- Expanded shared UI assets, icons, and styling for the new Vex layouts.
- Improved logging and build wiring for shared UI tooling.

## Notes

- This log covers commits 6b7cded and 1114e33.
