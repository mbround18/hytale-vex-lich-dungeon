# Friend Management UI Enters Shared Interfaces

We added a shared interfaces module focused on friend management, including commands, page handlers, and UI resources.

## Highlights

- New `InterfacesPlugin` wiring for the shared interfaces module.
- Friend list command, handler, and supporting codec utilities.
- Dedicated friend list UI pages with shared UI resources and language entries.

## Notes

- The interfaces module now includes reference pages for core UI flows.
- Friend interactions were added for debug tooling coverage.
