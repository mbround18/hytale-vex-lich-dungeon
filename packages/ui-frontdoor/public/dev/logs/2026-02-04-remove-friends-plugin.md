## Remove Friends Plugin

We removed the Friends/Party plugin stack to prepare for the upcoming native friends feature.

## Highlights

- Deleted Friends/Party services, commands, UI, and audio assets.
- Removed plugin wiring and related permissions entries.
- Simplified the build by dropping the friends module.
