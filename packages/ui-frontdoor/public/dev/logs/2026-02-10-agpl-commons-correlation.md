## AGPL Commons Rider + Correlated Events

Updated licensing to AGPL with a Commons rider and expanded the event-driven stack with correlation context, alongside new UI tooling and shared stream utilities.

## Highlights

- **License + commercial docs updated**: refreshed license text and added the commercial exception template.
- **Correlation context for events**: introduced correlation IDs across engine and dungeon events to connect related actions.
- **New UI manager app**: added a dedicated UI manager front-end with new shared styling and build setup.
- **Shared stream utilities**: added broadcast/stream helpers in ui-shared to support event-driven UI updates.
- **Serve CLI refactor**: reworked process management and server handling for more reliable orchestration.
