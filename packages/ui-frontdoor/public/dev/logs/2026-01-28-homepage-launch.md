# Vex Challenge Homepage

We shipped the first public-facing landing page for Vex's Dungeon Challenge. The page leans hard into the dark fantasy mood with custom colors, textured overlays, and glowing accents to match the mod's tone.

## Highlights

- Hero section built around the Vex narrative, with strong CTA buttons for GitHub and Ko-fi.
- Tailwind-based palette and font pairing (Cinzel + MedievalSharp) for a clean, thematic hierarchy.
- Navigation wired into the shared header script to keep the home and dev pages in sync.

## Notes

- Placeholder art is wired for quick replacement when final Vex renders are ready.
- The layout is mobile-aware and keeps the CTA stack accessible on smaller screens.
