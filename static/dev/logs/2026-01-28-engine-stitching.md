# Engine Stability Pass

We focused on core engine stability and dungeon assembly performance, especially around stitch generation and runtime pressure handling.

## Highlights
- Added backpressure controls to keep generation bursts stable.
- Expanded stitch tooling to support larger prefab catalogs.
- Continued the ImmortalEngine naming pass and system alignment.

## Notes
- This sets the stage for more predictable procedural runs as content scales.
