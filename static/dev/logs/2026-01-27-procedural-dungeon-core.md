# Procedural Dungeon Foundation

We moved from concept to a working dungeon generator with static room support.

## Highlights
- Base procedural generation pipeline is in place.
- Room generation now pulls from statics to ground layouts in authored content.

## Notes
- This gives us a reliable backbone before layering advanced rules and pacing.
